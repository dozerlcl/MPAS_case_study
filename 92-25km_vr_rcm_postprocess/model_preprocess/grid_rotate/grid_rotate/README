grid_rotate: Rotates a spherical NetCDF mesh according to user-specified
latitude, longitude, and bird's eye rotations

REVISION HISTORY:

    4 Sept 2015 - Generalized the Makefile and added a new NCL script,
                  mesh_resolution.ncl, that may be used to make a contour
                  plot of approximate grid resolution. 

   10 July 2013 - Fix issue where angleEdge was overwritten in output files
                  for meshes that don't provide fEdge and fVertex fields.

   14 June 2013 - Initial public release.



I. OVERVIEW

   This standalone application rotates a spherical NetCDF mesh and saves the
   output to a new NetCDF file.  There are three types of rotations that can be
   performed: a latitude shift, a longitude shift, and a rotation around an
   arbitrary axis.

   This is a standalone application written in Fortran90.


II. BUILDING THE CODE

   This standalone consists of the files: grid_rotate.f90, namelist.input, and
   Makefile

   Building requires NetCDF and a Fortran compiler.

   Update the Makefile to use your preferred compiler and make certain the
   environment variable NETCDF points to your installation of NetCDF; make


III.  RUNNING THE CODE

   Update the namelist.input file to specify the desired location. The variables
   are:
      config_original_latitude_degrees
      config_original_longitude_degrees
      config_new_latitude_degrees
      config_new_latitude_degrees
      config_birdseye_rotation_counter_clockwise_degrees

      config_original_latitude_degrees and config_original_longitude_degrees
         specify a reference point on the sphere (typically the center of a fine
         resolution region of the original mesh).

      config_new_latitude_degrees and config_new_latitude_degrees determine the
         latitude and longitude shift by specifying where the reference point is 
         rotated to.

      config_birdseye_rotation_counter_clockwise_degrees will adjust the
         orientation of the mesh with respect to the poles by rotating the mesh
         counter-clockwise around the reference point as viewed from a bird's eye
         perspective.


   Execute the application and specify as command-line arguments the NetCDF file
   that is to be rotated and the name to be given the generated output file.

      > grid_rotate input_filename.nc output_filename.nc


IV.   ADDITIONAL TOOLS
    
   The NCL file mesh.ncl is included with this application and can be used to
   plot grids before and after rotation.  To plot a file, modify the input
   filename on the line: 

      f = addfile("grid.nc","r")

   and run the script: 

      > ncl mesh.ncl
